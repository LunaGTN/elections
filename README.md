As part of a project in collaboration with my father, who is active in politics, I developed an **interactive dashboard** for his party to visualize election results for the city of Toulouse. This dashboard covers the 2020 municipal elections, the 2022 presidential elections, as well as the 2022 and 2024 legislative elections.

The process was structured around three key steps:

1. **Data cleaning and structuring**: I used **Pandas** to clean and format raw electoral data into a CSV file tailored to our needs.
2. **Visual analysis**: With **Plotly Express**, I created clear and impactful visualizations of electoral trends and comparisons across elections.
3. **Deployment with Streamlit**: I integrated these visualizations into an interactive and user-friendly web application, deployed via Streamlit, enabling intuitive access to the results.


This project transformed complex data into a **strategic tool**, offering quick and meaningful insights into local electoral dynamics.
